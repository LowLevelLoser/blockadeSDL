to compile enter this command: gcc `sdl2-config --libs --cflags` -o blockade logic.c rendering.c main.c

rules:
The goal of the game is to get more of your pieces down in the board than the other player 
You have to place your piece adjecently to the one you've previously played
There is also a neutral piece which both players can control it does not add to your count but it can be used to block your opponent
There is a limit on the amount of neutral pieces that can be placed both players share the same previous placement of the piece
When one player runs out of moves it automatically switches to the other player 
The game ends when both players run out of moves 

left click for the player piece
right click for the neutral piece

You'll get a better feel for it once you play it

also its probably better to play it on paper where red is X blue is O and gray is a square
